# Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Tabular Data Readers Incl. CSV <3 JSON, CSV <3 YAML And More

---

NOTE:  I (Gerald Bauer) am happy to work on a better (alternate) csv library for ruby, BUT unfortunately for now I have first to figure out how to survive and earn some money. unfortunately, ruby is no longer (never was really) in demand over here (in austria). 
thus, if you want to see progress - please ping me (gerald.bauer @ gmail.com) and your support is more than welcome.
