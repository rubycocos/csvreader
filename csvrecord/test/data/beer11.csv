## check for nil
"", ,,"",

## check for blank line with spaces
##    yes, will get added as a record!! e.g. ["", nil, nil, nil]
##    use regex to skip blank lines with spaces!!!!
    

## test double quotes and double quotes escaped
##   note: double quotes do NOT work with leading AND/OR trailing spaces
##    leads to:
##    CSV::MalformedCSVError - Missing or stray quote in line xxx
##
##   note: for now double quote does not accept leading AND/OR trailing spaces!!!!
##
##  todo/fix: check liberal_quote option starting in csv ruby 2.4 ???
##
## examples:
##  "value with comma, comma","some ""hello""","some ""hello""",
##    works - but does NOT work (note the leading and trailing spaces for double quotes):
##  "value with comma, comma" ,"some ""hello""",  "some ""hello""",
##
## check for "multi-line":
## "hello
##  and another line
##  and another",two,three,


"value with comma, comma","some ""hello""","some ""hello""",

## check for "multi-line"
"hello
  and another line
  and another",two,three,
